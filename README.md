493Search

A responsive web application for searching information on artists and their works. To execute an artist search, the user needs to type artist's name in the input box and press [enter]. The app will then call the iTunes API and display the results. For each returned result the app will display the artist's name, the name of the collection which the media work belongs to, along with its price, type, and a preview. Users can also filter the results by their genre, by using the genre buttons at the top of the page.

This project uses Angular, Bootstrap, and HTML5/CSS.
